This is a basic Unicode category library. Run `./maketables.py` to generate
code that will test whether a character is in a particular Unicode category.

Currently the only supported language is C++.

# Extending to other languages

The languages specific code is generated using Jinja templates. Contributions
for other languages are welcome.
